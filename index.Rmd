# Overview
some blurb

# Contact time
There is one lecture and 4 workshops. The lecture and the first three workshops are organised by Emma Rand.
The forth workshop is organised by Jon Pictchford.

## Session 1
Lecture: Introduction to Generalised Linear Models 
Slides: [html](slides/intro_to_glm.html), [pdf](slides/intro_to_glm.pdf), [Rmd](slides/intro_to_glm.Rmd)

## Session 2
Workshop 1: Linear Models
T-tests, ANOVA and regression are used when we have a continuous response variable.
We revisit these using a linear modelling framework. This means using a single function `lm()` rather than three different ones and enhancing our understanding of the concepts underlying the tests.
Workshop: [html](workbook/QCworkshop1DataAnalysis.html), [Rmd](workbook/QCworkshop1DataAnalysis.Rmd)


## Session 3
Workshop 2: Generalised Linear Models for Poisson distributed data
We extend our knowledge of linear models by considering other types of response variable: counts (Poisson).
Slides: [html](workbook/QCworkshop2DataAnalysis.html), [Rmd](workbook/QCworkshop2DataAnalysis.Rmd)


## Session 4
Workshop 3: Generalised Linear Models for Binomially distributed data
We extend our knowledge of linear models by considering other types of response variable: binary (binomial)
Slides: [html](workbook/QCworkshop2DataAnalysis.html), [Rmd](workbook/QCworkshop2DataAnalysis.Rmd)
